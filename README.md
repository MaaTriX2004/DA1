Simple yet Effective: Single Product Page for Sustainable Clothing (DA Project)

This repository presents a clean single product page designed for a sustainable clothing website. Built with HTML and CSS, it showcases clear product information, high-quality images, and a user-friendly layout. While simple in design, it focuses on providing a smooth user experience and lays the foundation for future feature additions.

I created this page as part of my DA project, gaining valuable insights into responsive design, accessibility, and best practices for e-commerce development. I welcome contributions and feedback to help this project grow.
